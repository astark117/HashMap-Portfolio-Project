# HashMap-Portfolio-Project
A portfolio project implementing a hashmap using chaining and open addressing

hashmap_oa.py utilizes quadratic probing to handle collisions. Load factor is calculated via a method and the table uses this to automatically resize if the load factor >= 0.5.

hashmap_sc.py utilizes chaining via linked lists to handle collisions. Load factor is calculated via a method and the table uses this to automatically resize if the load factor >= 1.

a6_include.py was provided as skeleton code and contains the classes for underlying data structures and iterators.
